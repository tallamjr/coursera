# Coursera Courses

Links to repositories containing material for completed (and work-in-progress) of coursers I have
attempted on the Coursera platform

**N.B**
- A ~~strike through~~ indicates the individual course has been completed.
- Hyperlinks are to repositories, not to course webpages.
- If there are broken links, this more likely means the repository is temporarily private.
